# Aspects of Robust Regression

This project considers a **comparison of Bayesian and frequentist methods** for robust regression. It involves a mix of theoretical analysis and simulations, with an emphasis on **high-dimensional regression with regularization**.  Comparing Bayesian and frequentist approaches is of interest both for the **foundations of inference** and for the **practical assessment of the reliability of Bayesian approaches**; the latter is closely related to the asymptotic theory of likelihood-based inference. Robust regression methods are an important technique for ensuring that statistical conclusions remain valid even when the model used for inference differs from the model generating the data.  New methods and theory for high-dimensional regression are an area of active development, and **robustness in this setting** is of particular interest.


This repository contains code and sample data for simulations and analyses related to the **Aspects of Robust Regression** project. The goal of this project is to explore the robustness of degree of freedom ($\nu$) and regression ($\beta$) estimators under different error distributions and contamination settings.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### **R Codes/**
This folder contains all R scripts used to generate, run, and analyze the simulations.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `df_sim.R` | Conduct degrees-of-freedom estimation simulations.|
| `df_sim_results.R` | Analyzes and summarizes df simulation outcomes. |
| `beta_tnormal_error_sim.R` | Simulates regression models with t-distributed errors to assess robustness under heavy-tailed noise. |
| `beta_stackloss_sim.R` | Reproduces simulations based on the Stackloss dataset for benchmark testing. |
| `beta_contaminated_error_sim.R` | Simulates regression models with contaminated normal error distributions. |
| `beta_sim_results.R` | Summarizes and visualizes simulation results for regression coefficient estimates. |

---

### **Sample Data/**
This folder includes 10 data files in `.Rda` produced from simulation runs. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific simulation setting.

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `df data/` | Contains simulation results for simuations regarding degree of freedom estimation. |
| `beta normal error data/` | Contains baseline simulations with normally distributed errors. |
| `beta stackloss data/` | Contains Stackloss dataset simulation outputs. |
| `beta terror data/` | Contains simulations under t-distributed error settings. |
| `beta contaminated error data/` | Contains beta estimation simulation results with contaminated non-t error structures. |

Each subfolder (e.g., `contaminated_2pterror_1`, `contaminated_2pterror_2`, etc.) stores multiple `.Rda` files (`allsim_1.Rda`, `allsim_2.Rda`, ‚Ä¶, `allsim_10.Rda`) corresponding to repeated runs for robustness evaluation.

## üß† Project Overview

Robust regression methods aim to reduce the influence of outliers and deviations from model assumptions (e.g., normality of errors).  
In this project, we:

- Compare classical and robust regression estimators under various error distributions.  
- Evaluate sensitivity to contamination and heavy tails using simulation studies.  
- Summarize estimator performance through bias, variance, and mean squared error (MSE) metrics.

## üß© Methods & Models

The project explores:
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** under ideal conditions.  
- **Robust alternatives** (e.g., M-estimators) under contamination or t-distributed noise.  
- The impact of sample contamination on estimator efficiency.  

Simulation setups include:
- Contaminated normal errors  
- Heavy-tailed t-distributed errors  
- Real-data-based Stackloss experiments

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Open the `R Codes/` directory.
2. Run the desired simulation file (e.g., `beta_tnormal_error_sim.R`) in R.
3. Results are automatically saved in the corresponding subfolder under `Sample Data/`.
4. Use `beta_sim_results.R` or `df_sim_results.R` to summarize or visualize simulation outcomes.

Example:
```r
# Run simulation with t-distributed errors
source("R Codes/beta_tnormal_error_sim.R")

# Summarize results
source("R Codes/beta_sim_results.R")
